## 📋 Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep line length under 88 characters (Black formatter standard)

### Code Formatting

We use Black for code formatting and flake8 for linting:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ ui/ tests/

# Check for linting issues
flake8 src/ ui/ tests/
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add docstrings to all new functions
- Include examples in your docstrings
- Update API documentation if you modify endpoints

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_api.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
